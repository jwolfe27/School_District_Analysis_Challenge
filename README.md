# School District Analysis
## Overview of School District Analysis
Maria and the School Board requested that test results for 15 schools within their district be analyzed as there may have been some dishonesty in score reporting, specifically results from the 9th Grade class at Thomas High School.

## Purpose
To uphold state testing standards and requirements by eliminating any results found to be reported dishonestly.  This was accomplished by removing the scores reported from the 9th Grade class at Thomas High School.

## Metrics Analyzed 
There were a total of 7 District Metrics used in our analysis:
 - Total Students
 - Total Budget
 - Average Math Score
 - Average Reading Score
 - % Passing Math
 - % Passing Reading
 - % Overall Passing

## Summary of District Analysis Results
### Scores With THS 9th Grade Results

### Scores Without THS 9th Grade Results

As shown above, there is minimal affect to the overall results reported when removing the THS 9th Grade Class results from the overall analysis. You can see there is a slight decrease in the Average Math Score, % Passing Math, % Passing Reading and % Overall Passing results.  Let's look at some additional district data collected to see if there is dishonesty in the results reported, as well as why there was such little affect to the overall performance across all 15 schools reporting test results

## Conclusion of Analysis
Reviewing the data provided above we can see that Thomas High School has a total student population of 1,635. This ranks 12 in terms of "School Size".  The student population of the 9th Grade class at THS is 461.  Removing the 461 math and reading test results ultimately had very little affect to the overall scores reported to the state.  The data shows that Thomas High School falls within the most successful parameters given the metrics analyzed. Although there are reports of dishonest test scores reported, I was not able to find any evidence to corroborate that claim.  The data shows that schools with a student population in the "Medium" range have the highest % Overall Passing at 91%.  Charter schools also show to have the highest % Overall Passing at 90%.  With Thomas High School falling into both of these categories, it is hard to find conclusive evidence that 9th Grade test results were reported dishonestly.
