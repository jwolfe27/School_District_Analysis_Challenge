# School District Analysis Challenge
## Overview of Project
Maria and the School Board requested that an analysis of state testing results be performed on 15 different school due to apparent dishonesty found with test results from the 9th Grade level at Thomas High School.  With the analysis now complete, we are able to visually see what effects the dishonesty had on overall Math and Reading results when the 9th Grade results from Thomas High School are included and removed from the analysis.  

### Purpose of the Analysis
To uphold state testing standards and integrity by removing all dishonest test results.  This was achieved by removing all Math and Reading test results (scores) from the 9th Grade class attending Thomas High School.  All other test results were found to be reported accurately, and honestly.

## School District Metrics
The analysis addressed a total of (7) district metrics as listed below:
 - Total Students
 - Total Budget
 - Average Math Score
 - Average Reading Score
 - % Passing Math
 - % Passing Reading
 - $ Overall Passing

## Summary of Results
As shown above, there is minimal difference noticed.  Given that Thomas High School ranks 12th in school size, removing only the 9th grade student body of 461 students' test scores does not affect the overall results too dramatically when factored into the overall district performance.  As shown, there is a very small decrease to the Avg Math Score, % Passing Math, % Passing Reading and % Overall Passing.

### Summary of District Analysis
The impact to overall results when removing the 9th Grade scores out of Thomas High School were minimal.  Thomas High School has a total student population of 1,635.  The total 9th Grade population is only 461 students.  Although there are claims of dishonesty in the Math and Reading scores, I found nothing to corroborate that claim.  Reviewing the other district data, smaller student population and school type show to affect testing scores across the board.  Thomas High School is a charter school with a small student body when compared to other schools in the district. Thomas High School falls in the "Medium" school size category, which show to have the highest % Overall Passing at 91%.
